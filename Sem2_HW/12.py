Task 12:
Petya and Katya are brother and sister. Petya is a student, and Katya is a schoolgirl. Petya helps Katya in math. 
He conceives two natural numbers X and Y (X,Yâ‰¤1000), and Katya must guess them. To do this, Petya makes two hints. 
He calls the sum of these numbers S and their product P. 
Help Katya to guess the numbers conceived by Petya.

s - sum of two numbers
p - multiply of this two numbers


s = x + y
p = x * y
x = p/y
y=s-x -> p= x * y
p = x*(s-x)
p = sx - x*x
x*x + (-sx) +p = 0

D = s*s - 4*1*p
1. D>0    x1=(s+sqrt(D))/2   x2 = (s-sqrt(D))/2   count =2
2. D = 0  x = s/2   count = 1
3. D<0    message - incorrect arguments
