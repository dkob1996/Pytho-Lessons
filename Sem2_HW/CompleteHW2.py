Task 10:
There are n coins on the table. Some of them are tails up, and some are coats of arms. 
Determine the minimum number of coins that need to be turned over so that all the coins are turned up with the same side. 
Print the minimum number of coins to flip

Task 12:
Petya and Katya are brother and sister. Petya is a student, and Katya is a schoolgirl. Petya helps Katya in math. 
He conceives two natural numbers X and Y (X,Yâ‰¤1000), and Katya must guess them. To do this, Petya makes two hints. 
He calls the sum of these numbers S and their product P. 
Help Katya to guess the numbers conceived by Petya.
