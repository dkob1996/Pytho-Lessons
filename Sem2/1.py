'''
1. For a given non-negative integer n, calculate the value of n!. 
N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N (the product of all numbers from 1 to N) 0! = 1 
Solve the problem using the while loop
Given a natural number A > 1. Determine which Fibonacci number it is,
that is, output a number n such that Ï†(n) = A.
If A is not a Fibonacci number, print the number -1.
