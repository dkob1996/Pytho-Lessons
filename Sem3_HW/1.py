'''
Task 16:
It is required to calculate how many times a certain number X occurs in the array A[1..N]. 
The user enters a natural number N in the first line â€“ the number of elements in the array. 
The following lines contain N integers Ai. The last line contains the number X

*Example:*

5
    1 2 3 4 5
    3
    -> 1

Try to do the task through your algorithm and through the method .count(). Evaluate the speed of work.
